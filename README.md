# Spotlight-8

The software can be used by downloading the current release (2023.12.12) zipped folder, and extracting the contents.

SpotlightStart.exe in the zipped folder launches the program.

Spotlight is an image tracking software orginally created at NASA at the Glenn Research Center by Robert Klimek and Ted Wright. The current version in the release updates the software to accept any codec contained in an .avi file.

This version of Spotlight requires ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/) to function, which is included in the release. Spotlight.Start.exe will only work when run out of the extracted release folder. A shortcut that has the .exe file as a target will work if it is desired to have the program on the desktop.
